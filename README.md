# Skicross 
The current technologies available for gathering and assessing pertinent factors within ski cross are
notably restricted and have yet to be integrated into training protocols. Accurate measurement of
athlete force at the ski cross race start is crucial for advantageous positioning, skill enhancement
and training optimization; however, current methods rely mainly on video analysis, lacking a
focused approach to optimize race start dynamics. Our designed product is an accessible, accurate
sensor-based system which gathers precise force data from race starts and plots it along with a
performance evaluation
